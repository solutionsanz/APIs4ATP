			git clone https://github.com/solutionsanz/APIs4ATP

   - In a terminal window, go to where you cloned/downloaded the repository (APIs 4 ATP) â€“ Notice that the Vagrantfile is already in there.

   - Start up your Vagrant Dev VM:

        vagrant up

   - A new Ubuntu VM will be provisioned and a bootstrap script will install all required utilities (e.g. docker).

   - You can now **vagrant ssh** into it.

   - Go to your working directory (mounted from host OS).

        cd /vagrant

   - Switch user to **ubuntu**

        sudo su ubuntu

   - Containerise the application by using the provided Dockerfile:

        docker build .

   - Execute locally your new Docker Image of your APIs 4 ATP Application:

        docker run --env-file setEnv -p 3000:3000 -it [image_id] 

     Note, if you are unsure about the actual **image_id**, you can use **docker images** to gather all images being generated.

     Also note that by default port 3000 was configured in by vagrant as part of your VM setup.

   - In your host OS, open a browser and go to: http://localhost:3000 - Test your app.
